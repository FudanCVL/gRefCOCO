# gRefCOCO - Dataset for GRES: Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation


**[🏠[Homepage]](https://henghuiding.github.io/GRES/)** &emsp; **[📄[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/)**

This repository contains information and tools for the [gRefCOCO](https://henghuiding.github.io/GRES/) dataset.


## Download

⬇️ Get the dataset from: 
 - ☁️ [OneDrive](https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liuc0058_e_ntu_edu_sg/EaEz86LZwtNBmUdD4oMo9TkBBJ5Kft-ctoxyJ4cFhsNlHQ?e=ibiOi4)
 - ☁️ [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXifNjJ8gKQAcPQWcCkCdNYvRrkS6nbQ/view?usp=sharing)

 >The released dataset contains the training split and the validation split. TestA and testB are temporarily held for competition on CodaLab.


## Usage

Like RefCOCO, gRefCOCO also should be used together with images from the `train2014` of [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#download). 

We will update this repository with full API package and documentation soon. Please follow the usage in the [baseline code](https://github.com/henghuiding/ReLA) for now.
